TIC TAC TOE
-----------

This little amazing text mode game was published 
by Al Sweigart in his book named 
"Invent your own computer games with Python". 

Now it is rewritten for the C++ programming 
language, primarily for my own fun and then to be 
able to run this game on any computer, even one that 
does not have a Python interpreter installed. 

Unlike the original version of the game, here I took 
the liberty of changing the order of the fields on 
the game board. Now it looks like this:

                     |   | 
                   1 | 2 | 3
                     |   |
                  -----------
                     |   |
                   4 | 5 | 6
                     |   |
                  -----------
                     |   |
                   7 | 8 | 9
                     |   |

I find this arrangement more convenient. Sorry, Al!
